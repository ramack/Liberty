deferred class G_THREAD_POOL [A_ROUTINE -> G_POOLED_ROUTINE]
	obsolete "G_THREAD_POOL is currently unusable because standard library is NOT thread safe. At all"
	-- A pool of threads executing A_ROUTINE concurrently.

	-- Sometimes you wish to asynchronously fork out the execution of work and
	-- continue working in your own thread. If that will happen often, the
	-- overhead of starting and destroying a thread each time might be too
	-- high. In such cases reusing already started threads seems like a good
	-- idea. And it indeed is, but implementing this can be tedious and
	-- error-prone.

	-- Therefore GLib provides thread pools for your convenience. An added
	-- advantage is, that the threads can be shared between the different
	-- subsystems of your program, when they are using GLib.

	-- To create a new thread pool, you use `make'. 

 	-- If you want to execute a certain task within a thread pool, you call `push'.

	-- To get the current number of running threads you call `threads_count'.
	-- To get the number of still unprocessed tasks you call
	-- `unprocessed_count'. To control the maximal number of threads for a
	-- thread pool, you use `max_threads' and `set_max_threads`.

	-- Finally you can control the number of unused threads, that are kept
	-- alive by GLib for future use. The current number can be fetched with
	-- `unused_threads_count'. The maximal number can be controlled by
	-- `max_unused_threads' and `set_max_unused_threads'. All currently unused
	-- threads can be stopped by calling `stop_unused_threads`.

	-- Note for Liberty users:

feature {} -- Creation
	make (a_max_threads_count: INTEGER; is_exclusive: BOOLEAN;) is
		-- Creation command of a new thread pool.

		-- Whenever you call `push', either a new thread is created or an
		-- unused one is reused . At most a_max_threads_count threads are
		-- running concurrently for this thread pool. `a_max_threads_count' = -1 allows
		-- unlimited threads to be created for this thread pool. 

		-- The newly created or reused thread now executes A_ROUTINE.command with a reference to Current G_THREAD_POOL.
		
		-- `is_exclusive' determines, whether the thread pool owns all threads
		-- exclusive or whether the threads are shared globally. If
		-- `is_exclusive' is True, `a_max_threads_count' threads are started immediately
		-- and they will run exclusively for this thread pool until it is
		-- destroyed by dispose. If `is_exclusive' is False, threads
		-- are created, when needed and shared between all non-exclusive thread
		-- pools. This implies that `a_max_threads_count' may not be -1 for exclusive
		-- thread pools.
		
		-- TODO: provide GError support ("..error can be NULL to ignore errors, or non-NULL to report errors. An error can only occur when exclusive is set to TRUE and not all max_threads threads could be created..")

		default_pointer -- could be GError **error);
		))
	end

feature {ANY} -- Commands
	push (some_data: like new_routine) is
		-- Inserts data into the list of tasks to be executed by pool. When the
		-- number of currently running threads is lower than the maximal
		-- allowed number of threads, a new thread is started (or reused) with
		-- the properties given to `make'. Otherwise data stays in
		-- the queue until a thread in this pool finishes its previous task and
		-- processes data.

		-- TODO: add GError support "error can be NULL to ignore errors, or non-NULL to report errors. An
		-- error can only occur when a new thread couldn't be created. In that
		-- case data is simply appended to the queue of work to do."

	set_max_threads (a_number: INTEGER) is
	-- Sets the maximal allowed number of threads for pool. A value of -1 means, that the maximal number of threads is unlimited.

	-- Setting max_threads to 0 means stopping all work for pool. It is effectively frozen until max_threads is set to a non-zero value again.
	-- 
	-- A thread is never terminated while calling func, as supplied by g_thread_pool_new(). Instead the maximal number of threads only has effect for the allocation of new threads in g_thread_pool_push(). A new thread is allocated, whenever the number of currently running threads in pool is smaller than the maximal number.

feature {ANY} -- Disposing
	dispose is
		--Frees all resources allocated for pool.

		-- If immediate is TRUE, no new task is processed for pool. Otherwise pool is not freed before the last task is processed. Note however, that no thread of this pool is interrupted, while processing a task. Instead at least all still running threads can finish their tasks before the pool is freed.

		-- If wait_ is TRUE, the functions does not return before all tasks to be processed (dependent on immediate, whether all or only the currently running) are ready. Otherwise the function returns immediately.

	set_max_idle_time (an_interval: NATURAL_32) is
		-- Set to `an_interval' the maximum interval (in 1/1000ths of a second)
		-- that a thread waiting in the pool for new tasks can be idle for
		-- before being stopped. This command is similar to invoking
		-- `stop_unused_threads' on a regular timeout, except, this is done on
		-- a per thread basis.
