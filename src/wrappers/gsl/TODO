* name conventions multiply, ... wann wird Result zurückgegene,wann wir Current verändert?

* add support to read from and write to streams (matrices and vectors)
* add view / subvector aliasing support
* add test for error codes
* implement some mechanism to handle matrix views
* add support for const matrices?
* clearify usage of c types float, int, ... all used in the c lib, - is the mapping correct?
* cleanup (do it) implementation of complex numbers, is there a possibility to use external attributes within a plugin

* implement lazy evaluation for transpose and friends. (e.g. blas functions may do this during the operation -> see CBLAS_TRANSPOSE_t)
  also use all these special functions which can be used if one knows that a matrix is symmetric, ...

* check whether it is worth to split the plugin into small parts
 ** if we have one big plugin we include all headerfiles which could slow down
    the compilation
	
* documentation a few tutorial examples
