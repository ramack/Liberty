- I won't use INTEGER, but INTEGER_32.

- matrices and vectors of size 0,0/0 are not supported

- usage of is_equal for real values is not recommended; we should provide a way
to compare all our objects with respect to a user definable epsilon, s.th. like
is_nearly_equal(other: like Current; epsilon: REAL_64): BOOLEAN.
This sould be used in contracts, (?and is_equal should probably be obsoleted?).
(use gsl_fcmp?)

- we newly use the eiffeltest tool from smarteiffel
